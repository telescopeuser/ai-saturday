Switching from one backend to another
If you have run Keras at least once, you will find the Keras configuration file at:

$HOME/.keras/keras.json

If it isn't there, you can create it.

NOTE for Windows Users: Please replace $HOME with %USERPROFILE%.

The default configuration file looks like this:

{
    "image_data_format": "channels_last",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "floatx": "float32",
    "backend": "tensorflow"
}
Simply change the field backend to "theano", "tensorflow", or "cntk", and Keras will use the new configuration next time you run any Keras code.
